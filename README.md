## Introduction
Backend development involves the server-side of applications and databases, focusing on what users don't see but what powers the user-facing side. It includes everything from APIs to databases to server logic.

## Fundamentals

### HTTP/HTTPS
- **Definition**: Protocols used for transferring data over the web.
- **Key Concepts**: Request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, headers, SSL/TLS encryption.

### RESTful APIs
- **Definition**: A design pattern for building APIs to enable communication between client and server.
- **Principles**: Statelessness, resource representation, standard methods and status codes.

### Databases
- **Types**: Relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases.
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Definition**: Processes to verify users' identity and grant access to resources.
- **Techniques**: JWT, OAuth, OpenID Connect, session-based authentication.

## Languages & Frameworks

### Node.js
- **Overview**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Strengths**: Asynchronous event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O.

### Express.js
- **Overview**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Key Features**: Middleware support, routing, template engines.

### Python & Django
- **Overview**: High-level Python web framework.
- **Key Features**: Built-in admin interface, ORM, security features.

### Java & Spring Boot
- **Overview**: Java-based framework for building standalone applications.
- **Key Features**: Inversion of control, aspect-oriented programming, microservices support.

### Ruby on Rails
- **Overview**: Server-side web application framework written in Ruby.
- **Key Features**: Convention over configuration, DRY principle, MVC architecture.

## Microservices Architecture
- **Definition**: Architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- **Principles**: Single Responsibility Principle, decentralized governance, scalability.

## DevOps Integration

### CI/CD
- **Definition**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to automate the software delivery process.
- **Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Definition**: Containerization involves packaging applications with their dependencies; orchestration manages containers.
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Importance**: Essential for maintaining and troubleshooting backend systems.
- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

## Security Best Practices
- **Key Areas**: Data encryption, input validation, secure APIs, regular security audits.
- **Principles**: Principle of least privilege, defense in depth, security by design.
